# Quote and To-Do Manager

A command-line program for managing quotes and to-do lists using SQLite3.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Bash**: The Bourne Again SHell, a command language interpreter.
- **SQLite3**: A C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.

You can install these using the following commands on Debian-based systems:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y bash sqlite3
